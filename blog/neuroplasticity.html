  <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
  <h3>7th September 2022</h3>
  
  <p>
    Neuroplascticity is known as the brain's ability to change and grow. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The brain can rewire it's neural networks and pathways so that we can more efficiently think, imagine and reflect.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that as we practice or do something, our brain will adapt to get better at it.
  </p>
  <p>
    A benefit of knowing this is that people can be assured to improve and learn better via consistent practice and good habits.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to further re-wire your brain you can practice doing something new - like juggling or learning an instrument.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personally I will be practicing meditation and reflection. I find doing this helps cement what I've learnt throughout my day.
  </p>
  <p>
    A video i found useful on habits is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk">Change Your Life - One Tiny Step at a Time.</a>
  </p>

  <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>

  <p>
    To have a growth mindset is to believe in yourself. To believe that you are capable of learning, improving and changing your life.
  </p>

  <p>
    To understand that your character, intelligence and creativity isn't fixed but malleable.
  </p> 

  <p> 
    That every difficulty, challenge and criticism a lesson.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus giving rise to motivation and persistence in improving oneself knowing that every step counts.
  </p>

  <p>I believe in my own potential. My potential to learn, improve, and achieve.</p>

  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHtpKIViyB0">Potential.</a>

  <p>From reflection i learn that self discipline ultimately comes from how much you're willing to sacrifice to achieve your goal. </p>

  <p>Afterall, nobody really makes sacrifices for things they don't believe in.</p>
