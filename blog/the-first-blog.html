    <h3>7th September 2022</h3>
    
    <p>Deep in the forest you stumble upon a clearing where a timber cottage stands humbly alone.</p>

    <p>As you approach you notice the decaying wooden walls blistered with white mould.</p>

    <p>Shrubs and weeds overgrown right up to the doorstep.</p>

    <p>This is no-doubt, a home long abandoned.</p>

    <p>You enter and find an old journal. Some pages torn and tattered.</p>

    <p>It seems to be the writings of a researcher whom once lived here.</p>

    <p>It describes his findings of a nearby bog and how it strangely calls to him. </p>

    <p>As you flip through the pages the writing gets increasingly messy and chaotic.</p>

    <p>Scrawled at the end are the words: BEWARE. BEWARE THE BLOG BOG BLORG.</p>
