  <h1>Reflection</h1>
  <h3>2nd October 2022</h3>
  
  <p><b>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</b></p>
  <p>1. I'm not a very good listener - i could do better.<br>
  2. Knowing about Neuroplascticity and how the brain can change, gives me confidence that i can improve.<br>
    3. I need to be more open minded as everyone has different backgrounds and biases.
  </p>

  <p><b>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</b></p>
  <p>Having values, empathy and self-awareness is vital when working and communicating with others.<br>
  Without these we cannot effectively and understand each other, our emotions or our own shortfalls; and if we can't understand, how can we learn? </p>

  <p><b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b></p>
  <p>The importance of reflection and meditation. I feel like i have benefited alot from this.</p>

  <p><b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b></p>
  <p>Honestly, it's just a bit time consuming. I'm not a very good writer but i try to improve.</p>

  <p><b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</b></p>
  <p>Javascript, HTML and CSS is just the tip of the iceberg. As programmers we'll be learning so much more during our career.<br>
  The core learning skills however are skills that can benefit us for a lifetime.<br>
  Also, as a relatively new programmer. These skills are more important to potential employer, as it can gauge how well we learn and adapt. </p>

  <p><b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b></p>
  <p>Personally I feel like the core learning could benefit someone more inexperienced to a collaborative working environment. <br>
  Though i understand the importance of such topics, the company I worked for previously for seven years also ran alot of similar training sessions. So a bit of repitition.</p>
