  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  <h3>7th September 2022</h3>
  
  <p>
    The other day when I was writing some code in a website called replit, and I couldnt understand why the code was giving me errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    I tried to google the errors, then methods I was using to see if I was using them right. Reread through my code at least 10 times. Got abit frustrated. Took a break and came back.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the end I copy and pasted my code from replit into the browser's DOM console - and weirdly enough the code seemed to run fine there.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point I had spent too much time on this problem. It was for a stretch goal anyway so I just left it there. 
  </p>  

  <p>
    Looking back I should have asked one of my programming coaches to help me understand what happened.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another time when i had a problem with my code. I managed to find the issue by testing each function I wrote to see if the output was what i expected.
  </p>
  <p>
    I found the problematic function - it was returning an undefined value, so rewrote that code to make it work.
  </p>

  <p>From my programming course there are problem solving techniques i've learnt to use somewhat confidently:</p>
  <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-a-pseudo-code/">Pseudocoding.</a>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">The rubber ducky method.</a>
  <a href="https://www.bugsnag.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-javascript-error">Reading error messages</a>
  <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/ode-to-console-log-c5a91fe01f45">Console.logging</a>
</p>
<p>
If those don't work i'll usually default to the following:
</p>
<p>
Taking a break to reflect, and coming back later with fresh eyes.
</p>
<p>
Just Googling the issue.
</p>
<p>
Just testing and trying something in the code.
</p>
<p>
Asking for help from my peers, coaches and programming friends - which probably includes asking you. :)
