    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <h3>8th September 2022</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p> Here at DevAcademy, I intend to learn the foundations of programming, to enable me to one day have a career as an adept web developer.</p>
    <p>I hope to leverage my programming skills in the BIM industry as it evolves in the future.</p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>A limitation i recognize in my own learning is that I need to practice to remember things long-term.</p>
    <p>Just watching a video tutorial isnt enough for me to remember. So I will be committed in being hands-on when I learn even if it takes abit more time.</p>
    <p>I Feel like as a strength i have a good understanding of javascript already, and am confident in my problem solving skills.</p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p>Managing time to stay on top of things will probably be hardest. Juggling commitments and getting enough sleep.</p>
    <p>Burning-out can be an issue, so having enough rest and a good work-life balance is vital. This will be a marathon and i will pace myself.</p>

    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    
    <p>I would like to develop my interpersonal skills so that I can better support and encourage others to do their best.</p>
    <p>To be a better listener, communicator and practice openmindedness.</p>
      
     
      <!-- A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you. -->
      
      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>I understand that the DevAcademy Bootcamp is full-on and requires my heavy commitment of which I am prepared to give.</p>
      
      <p>I'm abit of a workaholic, and will usually try to do most things myself, but I will always look for feedback as I understand it to be invaluable.</p>



      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>When working with others i am committed in maintaining a safe welcoming environment. </p>
      <p>We all come from different backgrounds with differing skillsets and values. </p>
      <p>What's important is that we are able to work and collaborate together with respect, kindness and understanding.</p>
      <p>I also expect myself to be challenged during the bootcamp. To learn, grow and strive not only in my programming but also with my human-skils.</p>
      
<!--       
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way -->

      <br>
      
      <p>When I need help I will not hesitate to ask around. I am surrounded by colleagues, friends and facilitators that are happy to help.</p>
      <p>I understand my study is mainly self-managed so I expect the facilitation team to provide some guidance and feedback every now and then so that i am not on the wrong track.</p>
