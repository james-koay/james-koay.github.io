    <h1>Javascript, HTML and the DOM</h1>

    <h3>8th September 2022</h3>
    
<p>Hello! In my previous <a href="html-css.html">tech blog</a>, I mentioned how Javascript is like the electrician when you're building a house.</p>

<p>The electrician wires up your house so that the lights turn on when you push a button.</p>

<p>Well today i'll be trying to explain how Javascript works with HTML and CSS in abit more depth.</p>

<p>First of all, we have three separate files. The .html, .css, and the .js files.</p>
<p>But how do they talk to each other? Within the HTML file, there are links to whatever .css and .js files that it uses.</p>
<p>Your web browser reads these links and creates a DOM; a Document Object Model, and applies the styling from the CSS file and runs the code in the Javascript file.</p>
<p>The DOM translates the html file so that it's elements are represented in a way that can be read by the Javascript code - as objects and nodes with a tree-like structure</p>
<p>This tree-like structure acts like a map for objects so that the Javascript file knows where to find things.</p>

<p>For example, lets say the DOM is a forest and we want to reference a specific leaf on a tree.</p>

<p>It's kind of hard to point out which leaf you're referring to... so we have to describe it like this:</p>
<p>"It's the 2nd leaf on the 4th branch of tree number 3."</p>
<p>We'd denote that in javascript kinda like this: 'tree3.branch4.leaf2'</p>

<br>

<h1>Javascript Programming</h1>

<p>So now that you kinda know how Javascript references things. Lets talk about how the Javascript code runs.</p>
<p>The order in which the code is read and executed is called the 'Control Flow'.</p>
<p>It's usually from top to bottom until it reaches special instrucions like a loop, function or conditional statement;</p>
<p>in which case can be like a 'pick your own adventure' book, where you jump and skip pages as directed.</p>
<p>But lets say we have a robot chef. And we want to tell it how to make some hearty soup.</p>
<p>So lets write some Javascript code. It'll be like the instructions on a recipe that we'll give to our robot chef.</p>
<p>First we need some ingredients. Each ingredient will be an 'Object', and we'll put it into an array called 'vegetables'.</p>
<p>An array is basically a container for objects. But it can also contain more arrays; like a box inside a box.</p>

<div class="codeblock">
  <p>vegetables=["Potato","Onion","Carrot","Capsicum"]</p>
</div>

<p>Then we need to teach our robot chef to chop. Below is an function we can write to 'teach' our robot how to chop things:</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<p>function chop(thing){
<br>
result = "Chopped " + thing
<br>
console.log(result)
<br>
}
</div>

<p>Now that it knows how to chop things, we can give it the following command to chop a "Potato": </p>

<div class="codeblock">
  chop("Potato")
  </div>

<p>This will return "Chopped Potato" in our console.</p>

<p>But lets say we wanna chop all the vegetables in our list. Instead of giving an instruction to chop for each vegetable,</p>
<p>We can create a loop:</p>

<div class="codeblock">
  vegetables.forEach(item=> chop(item))
  </div>

<p>This loop will execute the chop function for each item in the vegetable list. It will return in our console:
    <br>
    "Chopped Potato" 
    <br>
    "Chopped Onion"
    <br>
    "Chopped Carrot"
    <br>
    "Chopped Capsicum"
 </p>

<p>We can then throw that loop into another function and maybe add some meat and do the same:</p>

<div class="codeblock">

meats=["Beef","Pork"]<br>
<br>
function prepareSoup(){<br>
  vegetables.forEach(item=> chop(item))<br>
  meats.forEach(item=> chop(item))<br>
  console.log("Cooked and boiled Everything")<br>
  console.log("Soup is Ready")<br>
}
</div>

<p>Now we have a single function/command we can tell our robot chef to prepare soup.</p>
<p>It'll chop all the meat in the meats container(array), veges in the vegetables container(array) and cook and boil everything.</p>
<p>When we run prepareSoup() we'll get:
<br>
<br>
"Chopped Potato" 
<br>
"Chopped Onion"
<br>
"Chopped Carrot"
<br>
"Chopped Capsicum"
<br>
"Chopped Beef"
<br>
"Chopped Pork"
<br>
"Cooked and boiled Everything"
<br>
"Soup is Ready!"
<br>
<br>
</p>
