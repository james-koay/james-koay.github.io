    <h1>My Identity and Values</h1>

    <h3>8th September 2022</h3>
    
<p>   
Here i write about my identiy and values, to reflect upon my past that has made me who i am in the present.
<br>
<br>
I was born into a christian family and I've been told the christian stories since i was young.
<br>
But thats all they were to me at first; stories, fairytales and fables.
<br>
It was in highschool when I first started critically thinking about religion, ethics and values in a serious manner.
<br>
I guess I was trying to understand my place in the world, whether God exists or if anything has actual meaning.
<br>
I didn't know at the time but my conclusion back then that lead me to seek more about christianity was called Pascal's Wager. 
<br>
I believe i've come a long way since then.
<br> 
My moral compass and values now grounded in my christian faith, from which i also draw my strength.
<br>
There is a bible verse that describes the characteristics i endeavor to pursue in life - Galatians 5:22-23:
<br>
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
<br>
<br>
Though this may be my background I understand that everyone has their own past, their own values and their own story that shapes them.
<br>
When working with others in tense situations, I find that being able to calmly listen and communicate with respect allows for a compromise to present itself.
<br>
Afterall, we're all so different. How can we come to an agreement if we don't understand each other's story?
<br>
<br>
As of writing this, i am near 31 years old. Though i've come a long way in my learning journey and career, 
<br>
I feel like web development is a whole new mountain to climb and i'm not as young and free as i used to be. 
<br>
I'm not sure if i'll ever reach the peak and achieve my goals, but i'm committed to start the climb. 
<br>
This isn't something anyone can do alone, so if you're also just starting your journey why not join me?
<br>
Tell me your story, take your time. We've got a whole mountain to climb afterall.
