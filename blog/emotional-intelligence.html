    <h1>EI and IQ</h1>
    
    <h3>13th September 2022</h3>
    

<p>Most people would have heard of the intelligence quotient(IQ). </p>
<p>It is a score to more or less determinine one's innate cognitive abilities;</p>
<p>to analyse, understand, and to think critically and logically.</p>
<p>In today's working environment however, one must also have emotional intelligence(EI) to have a successful carreer.</p>
<p> Emotional Intelligence(EI) is one's awareness and ability to handle emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>To be able to not only understand and empathize with others, but also to be self-aware of their own emotions and how they express them.</p>

<p>IQ and EI is like booksmarts vs streetsmarts.</p>

<p>People with good EI tend to have great social skills. They are excellent with relationships and can manifest great leadership skills.</p>
<p>Good EI can also manifest as one's capability to be self-motivated and to handle stress. </p>
<p>Undoubtedly these are all essential skills for a successful career in today's collaborative environment.</p>

<p>Though IQ is bascially innate and fixed. It is interesting that EQ is malleable.</p>
<p>You are able to improve yourself by increasing your emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>But just like everything else you learn, EQ comes with practice. You have to practice self-awareness.</p>
<p> Practice being positive. Practice being empathatic. Practice being compassionate.</p>
<p> It might take awhile but it's surely worth it.</p>
