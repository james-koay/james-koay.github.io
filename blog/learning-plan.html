    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <h3>8th September 2022</h3>
    
    <p> 
      Here at DevAcademy, I intend to learn the foundations of programming, to enable me to one day have a career as an adept web developer.
      I hope to leverage my programming skills in the BIM industry as it evolves in the future. 
    </p>

    <p>
      A limitation i recognize in my own learning is that I need to practice to remember things long-term. 
      Just watching a video tutorial isnt enough for me to remember. So I will be committed in being hands-on when I learn even if it takes abit more time.
    </p>
    

    <p>I would also like to develop my interpersonal skills so that I can better support and encourage others to do their best.</p>
      
     
      <!-- A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you. -->
      
      <p>I understand that the DevAcademy course is full-on and requires my heavy commitment of which I am prepared to give.</p>
      
      <p>
      I'm abit of a workaholic, and will usually try to do most things myself, but I will always look for feedback as I understand it to be invaluable.
      Burning-out can be an issue, so having enough rest and a good work-life balance is vital. This will be a marathon and i will pace myself.
      </p>

      <p>
      When working with others i am committed in maintaining a safe welcoming environment. 
      We all come from different backgrounds with differing skillsets and values. 
      What's important is that we are able to work and collaborate together with respect, kindness and understanding.
      </p>
      
<!--       
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way -->
      
      <p>When I need help I will not hesitate to ask around. I am surrounded by colleagues, friends and facilitators that are happy to help. 
      </p>
      <p>I understand my study is mainly self-managed so I expect the facilitation team to provide some guidance and feedback every now and then so that i am not on the wrong track.
